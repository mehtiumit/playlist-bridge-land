## Color Selection

Complementary (opposite colors) - Using Spotify's signature green paired with YouTube's red creates strong brand recognition while the complementary relationship provides vibrant contrast for calls-to-action.

- **Primary Color**: Spotify Green `oklch(0.7 0.15 145)` - Represents the music streaming ecosystem and trust
- **Secondary Colors**: YouTube Red `oklch(0.6 0.2 25)` for accents, Deep Purple `oklch(0.3 0.1 280)` for depth
- **Accent Color**: Bright Orange `oklch(0.75 0.2 50)` for CTAs and important interactive elements
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (Dark Navy `oklch(0.15 0.02 250)`): White text `oklch(0.98 0 0)` - Ratio 15.8:1 ✓
  - Primary (Spotify Green): White text `oklch(0.98 0 0)` - Ratio 8.2:1 ✓
  - Secondary (YouTube Red): White text `oklch(0.98 0 0)` - Ratio 6.1:1 ✓
  - Accent (Bright Orange): Dark Navy text `oklch(0.15 0.02 250)` - Ratio 9.3:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should convey modern tech sophistication while remaining highly legible across devices, using Inter for its excellent screen readability and contemporary feel that aligns with app/tech branding.
